      <h1>Jackfruit Jam Receipe</h1>
          <b><i>Ingredients:</i></b><br>
<ul>
<li>Rounded or varika (Kerala location) ripe jackfruit - 2nos</li>
<li>jaggery - 500 gm</li>
<li>cow's milk - 4 liters</li>
<li>organic ghee - 500 gm</li>
<li>scotch butter or plain butter - 1 packet</li>
<li>mixed fruits - 200  gm</li>
<li>dry mixed fruits - 200 gm</li>
<li>cardamon - 10 pieces</li>
<li>dry ginger - 4 pieces</li>
<li>paneer - 2 pieces</li>
<li>cashewnut - 15 pieces</li>
<li>Ripe mangoes - 2 pieces (optional)</li>
<li>Bread - 2 packs</li>
</ul>

<p>COOKING METHOD:
&#128540; &#9758;Cut open varika jackfruit into four parts and peel off the jackfruit leaving out its seeds and outer coverings.
Jackfruits has 2 varities - one is varika or rounded and other is kuzha or long jackfruit.  Rounded one
has more honey, juicy and more preferred jackfruit for jam.  Using knife (old traditional method) or 
mixer, slice all peeled jackfruits into very tiny small pieces.  In a 1/4th bowl of water or as required,
put the jaggery into this bowl and simmer it under low flame.  Remove it once jaggery is melted or can use
jaggery powder.  Filter it using normal filter method to keep it pure.  Slice all the fruits in a jar into small pieces or use
a knife.  Similarly, powder few dry fruits.  Separately powder dry ginger.  Separately, powder few cardamon into a fine powder.
Crush few cashewnut or break it into tiny small pieces.  In a pan, pour ghee 4 tbsp and kept aside cashewnuts,
cardamon, cashewnuts, dry mixed fruits, dry grapes, mixed fruits separately and stir it gently until golden brown.  Keep all aside for now.  Cut
ripe mangoes into small pieces.&#9995;
<br>
&#9758;Graft the coconut and squeeze out the milk from it seperating three layers of milk - water added to the 
grafted coconut and squeeze out through a filter.  Put out the grafted coconut ones into another vessel. 
After the first layer is done, this milk will be very thick.  Repeat this process 2 more times and separate each 
layer.&#9995;
<br>
&#9758;Under low flame, in a bowl or as desired utensil put all the chopped jackfruits pieces into it and add all jaggery 
content and stir CONTINUOUSLY for quite sometime until it gets thickened and becomes stiff, make sure little bit of 
ghee is added to avoid sticking to utensil or bowl.  Add 3rd part of milk to the content in the bowl and stir again 
CONTINUOUSLY.  Once the flavor smell comes up, keep pouring bit of ghee and 2nd part of milk into the bowl.
The content will look thickened, bit hard and bit smaller.  Add 1st part of milk to the content and stir ONLY for 
5 to 10 minutes.  Add first powdered dry fruits followed by a half of butter with bit of ghee and stir in very low flame.
Add simmered mixed fruits along with simmered cashewnuts.  Stir for 2 minutes.  Add cardamon powder and dry ginger
powder of very low quantity, say 1/2 tbsp (smaller one).  Add paneer if needed.&#9995;
<br>
&#9758;Butter the bread pieces of 2 each and in a pan add bit of ghee along with butter and paneer and roast it
until golden brown.  Put out the flames.  Add 2 small mangoes slices into bread pieces and jackfruit jam.
If needed, run the mixer with few ripe jackfruit pieces and gets its juice applied on to the bread pieces adding exotic 
tasty sweetness as jackfruit has honey inside it.  Keep jam in a tightly contained jar ALWAYS.&#9995;
