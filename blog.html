      <h1>Ukraine Russia Battlefield</h1>
  <p>Humanitarian Crisis -WHO should be given powers to lead a role in  
human crisis where people are caught in crossfires needing hospitalization,
food, shelter, transportation. International Red Cross should be in forefront 
of such wars with full protection assuring from both sides not to target them
ensuring dire consequences if any or provocation.  Use of human shields as
protection from assault should make way for future country involved in it to be
isolated from world forever in future. In conflicts, the normal human ones are
the worst sufferers with nothing in hand.  All that had worked up to build homes,
families and so on burned with egotism and self greed powers under guise of one excuse or
other.</p>

    <div class = "picturesque">Battles of Stupidity</div>
      <p>Anyone cares for normal human beings who are being targeted
who lived a normal life until this blood thirsty stupidity war began? Guess for whose
benefit?</p>
      <p>Those countries involved in war hardly care for normal humans.  Their
ultimate goal is create ruckus and leave the places unfit for civilization in years
to come with all poisonour toxics prevailing in air suffocating human lives.  Any
lessons learned from nuclear plant disasters in Russia?  Now to occupy for what?
Criticism over each other for greediness should stop immediately and let people
lead a normal life.  Countries making money by selling their weapons for its own 
benefit where innocent people get killed.  Disgusting, living happily at people's
sufferings these leaders.  Tit-for-tat response should be punishable under Geneva Accord.
Countries should stop interfering in Geneva's Accord. We, the people of world cannot sit and watch
donkey's show running in Ukraine. Can we? Do you want to suffer if voices are not raised? Voice your 
opinion which counts.  Every voice counts. Do you want to be a &#9760; ?</p>

      <h3>Worthless war -  Burned to Ashes</h3>
      <p>Does anyone think, as a result of this unworthy war whether NATO-US on one side
and Russia on other side, of disastrous climatic consequences that is foreseen in future
with destruction and chaos in each country that inflicts humans lives with pain and greed?
With all these poisonous air released into air, atmosphere will change.  More unpredictable
climatic consequences are bound to happen if countries fight for worthless reasons.
Do these filthy leaders of G7 or other so called organizations really able to do anything other than
just stand and watch the climatic consequences that is prevalent today and tomorrow and only
start mouthing when terrible beyond imagination climate incidents occur on a day-to-day-basis>
World is starving and these leaders only interested to bully each other at the cost of human lives.</p>

      <h4>Fake News & Fake Images for publicity - YouTube</h4>
    <p>Adding to conflict, is news media conflict that intends to further aggravate
the war for selfish reasons forcing people to react to situations before being verified
whether such news and pictures of war are original in nature.  Would these war-mongers
stop publishing these kinds of provocation to war or infuriate people's minds?  Publishing
such may fetch these war-mongers bit of money but consequences of death, destruction and
destructive life is far wrenching and painful memories.</p>
