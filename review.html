   <h1> 21ST CENTURY OLYMPICS, JAPAN
  </h1>
<div class="jap">
<p>  The Olympics in Japan was the most focused event to be held despite repeated delays and unpredictable outcome with raving  corana taking a toll on human lives and financially draining resources or to say depleted stopping everything on its way to destruction even worse than war probably bringing the world to its knees.  Harsh criticism followed by help rendered by so-called organizers with public outcry determined to put the seal on conducting prestigious olympic events added more fuel of fire to organizers who on the whole had to take risk adverse events facing assault among themselves with some on defensive opinion against the event.  Each and every second was dread with coeona virus spread consuming even worse the entire Japan with death trending upwards wuth risk of spreading further with uncontrollable consequences for the world with Olympics perhaps not the right time to conduct with dead bodies around us in every nook and corner of the countries with citizens beung confined to their house.  The air was filled with corona viruses with overflowing hospital conditions albeit pre-planned Olympics conditions financially goung down the drain on one side which could have been utilised for healthcare and could have conducted the event in a better way than rushing to do it, that too at a time when world was mourning for days.   Had it been conducted now, it would be 3 joyous welcome back üòÅ</p>

 <h4> Nature's Fury Of Destruction</h4>
 <p> Despite leap in technology and advancement in life, nature swallows everything on its path within seconds caused by man-made destruction of earth.  All that is built over years are lost forever as Street become river, roads become a lake, building become a swimming pool.  With each passing day, there isn't a situation where floods hasnt occurred.</p> <br>
